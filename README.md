In this project, we aim to develop a Movie Recommender System using Web Mining techniques that will provide users with accurate and relevant movie recommendations based on their individual preferences and viewing history. The proposed system will collect data from various sources on the web, such as user ratings, reviews, and movie metadata, and use this information to train a recommendation algorithm that considers various factors such as genre, director, cast, and user behavior. The system will be built using Python and several Python libraries such as Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, and Scikit- learn. The collected data will be pre-processed, cleaned, and transformed into a suitable format for analysis. The algorithm will then be trained using machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid filtering, to suggest movies that are most likely to be of interest to the user.
